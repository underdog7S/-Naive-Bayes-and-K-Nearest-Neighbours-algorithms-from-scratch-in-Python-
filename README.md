Implement the Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbours algorithms from scratch in Python using Numpy and Pandas and Matplotlib for visualization.
The code performs the following tasks: data import, data exploration and analysis, handling missing values, computing age statistics, extracting salutations from names, computing fare statistics and ranges.
converting categorical variables to numeric representations, dropping unnecessary columns, model training and evaluation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes algorithms, and data visualization.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric algorithm for classification and regression, finding neighbors to predict labels based on majority voting.
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm assuming feature independence, commonly used for classification, predicting labels based on calculated probabilities.
Data visualization uses graphs and plots to present data visually. Code includes various visualizations like bar charts, histograms, pie charts, and line plots to show patterns in survivor demographics and model performance.
